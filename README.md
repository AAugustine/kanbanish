## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kanbanish.git
cd kanbanish
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Firebase configuration:

```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

4. Set up Firebase Database Rules:

   - Go to your Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/
   - Select your project
   - Navigate to "Realtime Database" > "Rules" tab
   - Replace the rules with the following to ensure proper permissions for user preferences:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "boards": {
      ".read": true,
      ".write": "auth !== null"
    },
    "users": {
      "$userId": {
        "preferences": {
          ".read": "$userId === auth.uid",
          ".write": "$userId === auth.uid"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
