## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure

```javascript
// Column structure with groups
{
  "columnId": {
    "title": "Column Title",
    "cards": {
      // Individual cards not in groups
    },
    "groups": {
      "groupId": {
        "name": "Group Name",
        "created": timestamp,
        "expanded": true/false,
        "cards": {
          // Cards within this group
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Key Components

- **CardGroup**: Renders grouped cards with expand/collapse functionality
- **Card**: Updated to support selection mode and group membership
- **Column**: Enhanced with multi-select UI and group creation modal

### Drag and Drop

- Cards can be dragged between columns, groups, and individual positions
- Groups serve as drop targets for cards
- Drag is disabled during multi-select mode to prevent conflicts

## Styling

### CSS Classes

- `.card-group`: Main group container
- `.card-group-header`: Group header with name and controls
- `.card-group-content`: Expanded group content area
- `.card-group-preview`: Collapsed group preview with stacking
- `.card.selected`: Selected card styling
- `.multi-select-mode`: Cards in selection mode

### Visual Effects

- Smooth expand/collapse animations
- Stacking effect for collapsed groups
- Selection indicators and highlights
- Hover states for interactive elements

## Accessibility

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Group names can be edited with Enter/Escape keys
- **Screen Readers**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators for all interactive states
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Destructive actions (ungroup) show confirmation

## Browser Compatibility

The feature uses modern CSS and JavaScript features:

- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- CSS Custom Properties for theming
- ES6+ JavaScript features
- React Hooks for state management

Supports all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:

- **Nested Groups**: Groups within groups for complex organization
- **Group Templates**: Save and reuse common group structures
- **Batch Operations**: Apply actions to all cards in a group
- **Group Statistics**: View metrics for grouped cards
- **Color Coding**: Custom colors for different group types
